Paulina's Palindrome Checker

Hey there! 🌟  I hope this little project helps you out or at least gives you a chuckle. Happy coding!

With this task ive decided decided to build a simple palindrome checker. This project helps you see if a word or phrase reads the same backward as forward (like “racecar” or “A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!”). It’s a fun little project and I’m excited to share it with you! (sorry for all the pink)

What This Does

Checks if your input is a palindrome: Just type in a word or phrase and see if it’s the same backward.
Shows the result in a nice way: You get a clean and pretty page showing if your input is a palindrome or not.
How to Use It

1. Clone the Project
First, you need to get the code. Open your terminal and run:
bash
Copy code
git clone : 
2. Install the Packages
You need to install some packages to make everything work. In your terminal, run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the Server
Now, you need to start the server to make the web app run. Just type:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see the app!
Files in the Project

index.html: This is where you type in your word or phrase.
server.js: This handles the magic of checking if your input is a palindrome.
public/: This folder has the styling to make things look nice.
How It Works

Input Form:
You type a word or phrase into a form on the webpage.
The app checks if it’s a palindrome.
Response Page:
After you submit, it tells you if your input is a palindrome or not.

Feel free to use this however you like! I’m just learning, so this is pretty simple.
